# Feature Specification: Migrate Database to Supabase

**Feature Branch**: `004-description-change-database`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Change database from local to online via Supabase. Migrate existing data to Supabase."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Application uses Supabase database (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the application to use an online Supabase database so that my data is accessible from anywhere and is reliably stored in the cloud.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the featureâ€”moving from local to online database is the main goal.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring the app to use Supabase and verifying all data operations (CRUD) work as expected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is configured to use Supabase, **When** a user performs data operations, **Then** the data is stored and retrieved from Supabase.
2. **Given** the app is running, **When** the local database is disabled, **Then** the app continues to function using Supabase only.

---

### User Story 2 - Data migration to Supabase (Priority: P2)

As an admin, I want all existing data to be migrated from the local database to Supabase so that no user data is lost in the transition.

**Why this priority**: Ensures continuity and data integrity for all users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing data in local and Supabase databases after migration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing data in the local database, **When** migration is performed, **Then** all data appears in Supabase with no loss or corruption.

---

### User Story 3 - Minimal downtime during migration (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the migration to Supabase to cause minimal downtime so that my experience is not disrupted.

**Why this priority**: User experience is improved if the migration is seamless.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring application downtime during migration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the migration process is started, **When** users access the app, **Then** they experience little or no downtime.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the Supabase connection fails during normal operation?
- How does the system handle partial data migration or migration errors?
- What if the data schema in Supabase differs from the local schema?
- How is data consistency ensured if users modify data during migration?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to Supabase as the primary database for all data operations.
- **FR-002**: System MUST migrate all existing data from the local database to Supabase, preserving data integrity and relationships.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a way to verify that all data has been migrated successfully.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle connection failures to Supabase gracefully, with appropriate user messaging and fallbacks.
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure minimal downtime during the migration process.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure that the Supabase schema matches the application's data requirements. Schema changes MUST be reviewed manually before applying to production; automation may be used for initial sync and non-destructive updates, but all destructive or breaking changes require explicit manual review and approval.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent data loss or duplication during migration.

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents an application user; attributes include unique ID, profile info, authentication data.
- **Song**: Represents a music track; attributes include title, artist, album, metadata.
- **Album**: Represents a music album; attributes include title, release date, associated songs.
- **Playlist**: Represents a user-created or system-generated playlist; attributes include name, list of songs, owner.
- **QueueItem**: Represents a song in a user's play queue; attributes include song reference, position, user reference.
- **Other Entities**: Genre, Photo, Payment, etc., as defined in the current data model.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of data from the local database is present and accurate in Supabase after migration.
- **SC-002**: Application operates exclusively on Supabase with no critical errors for 7 consecutive days post-migration.
- **SC-003**: User-reported issues related to data loss or downtime do not exceed 1% of active users during migration.
- **SC-004**: Migration process results in less than 30 minutes of total downtime for users.
