# Research: Supabase Schema Migration Automation vs Manual Review

## Decision

Schema changes for Supabase should be **reviewed manually before applying** to production. Automation may be used for initial sync and non-destructive updates, but all destructive or breaking changes require explicit manual review and approval.

## Rationale

- Manual review ensures that any changes to the schema do not inadvertently break application functionality or cause data loss.
- Automated tools can be used to generate migration scripts and apply non-breaking changes, but human oversight is critical for production safety.
- Supabase provides migration tools, but best practice is to review all changes, especially when migrating from a different environment or schema.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Fully automated schema migration**: Fast, but risks unintentional data loss or breaking changes if not carefully managed.
- **Manual-only migration**: Safe, but slower and more error-prone for large or frequent changes.
- **Hybrid approach (chosen)**: Use automation for initial sync and safe updates, but require manual review for destructive or complex changes.
