# Implementation Plan: Deploy Application with Supabase

**Branch**: `005-description-deploy-application` | **Date**: 2025-10-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-description-deploy-application/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deploy the MuzikApp application with Supabase as the online database. The frontend (Next.js) will be deployed via Vercel, and the backend (ASP.NET Core) will be deployed via Render. Both deployments will use environment variables to securely connect to Supabase. The process will be automated for reliability and repeatability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# (.NET 8), TypeScript (ES2022), Node 20 LTS  
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core, EF Core (Npgsql), Next.js, Supabase JS client, AutoMapper, FluentValidation, TailwindCSS  
**Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL (managed cloud DB)  
**Testing**: xUnit (backend), React Testing Library, Playwright (frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Backend: Render (Linux container), Frontend: Vercel (serverless/edge)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js frontend, ASP.NET Core backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms p95 for main user actions, 99.9% uptime, <10min deployment time  
**Constraints**: No secrets in client bundle, environment variables managed via Vercel/Render dashboards, must use Supabase for all data  
**Scale/Scope**: All current users and data, support for future scaling to 10k+ users

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

The plan MUST address the following gates from the Constitution:

- Naming & Style: Confirm C# (PascalCase, Async suffix, DTO suffix) and TS (PascalCase components, camelCase funcs) conventions.
- Modularity: Controllers thin, services/repositories separation; Next.js services for data; reusable UI components.
- Test Plan: Backend unit tests (xUnit) and frontend integration/E2E (RTL/Playwright) defined for this feature.
- Simplicity: Justify any added dependency or abstraction beyond existing patterns.
- Git & CI: Branch naming, Conventional Commits, and CI checks (build, lint, tests) defined.

**Structure Decision**: Use the existing monorepo structure:

- `Muzik/` for backend (ASP.NET Core, EF Core)
- `client/` for frontend (Next.js, Supabase client)
- Deployment scripts/configs for Vercel and Render will be added as needed.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
