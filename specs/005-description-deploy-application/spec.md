# Feature Specification: Deploy Application with Supabase

**Feature Branch**: `005-description-deploy-application`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Deploy application with Supabase as online database. Deploy both backend and frontend."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Deploy full application online (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want the entire application (backend and frontend) to be deployed and accessible online, using Supabase as the database, so I can use it from anywhere.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of deploymentâ€”making the app available to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the deployed app and verifying all features work with Supabase data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is deployed, **When** a user visits the frontend URL, **Then** they can log in and use all features with live data from Supabase.
2. **Given** the backend is deployed, **When** the frontend makes API calls, **Then** the backend responds using Supabase as the data source.

---

### User Story 2 - Environment configuration for deployment (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to configure environment variables and deployment settings for both backend and frontend, so the app connects to Supabase and runs securely in production.

**Why this priority**: Proper configuration is essential for a secure and functional deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing deployment configs and verifying the app uses the correct Supabase credentials and URLs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** deployment configuration files, **When** the app is started, **Then** it connects to Supabase and does not expose secrets in the frontend.

---

### User Story 3 - Automated deployment process (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want an automated deployment process for backend and frontend, so updates can be released quickly and reliably.

**Why this priority**: Automation reduces errors and speeds up delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a deployment and verifying the app is updated online.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new code change, **When** the deployment process runs, **Then** the updated app is live with no manual intervention.

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the deployment fails for either backend or frontend?
- How does the system handle incorrect or missing environment variables?
- What if Supabase is temporarily unavailable during deployment?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST deploy the backend (ASP.NET Core) to a cloud or server environment with Supabase as the database.
- **FR-002**: System MUST deploy the frontend (Next.js) to a cloud or server environment, configured to connect to Supabase.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use environment variables to securely manage Supabase credentials and URLs.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a deployment process that can be triggered automatically (e.g., via CI/CD pipeline).
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure that no sensitive credentials are exposed in the frontend bundle.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide error handling and rollback options if deployment fails.

### Key Entities

- **DeploymentConfig**: Represents deployment settings and environment variables for backend and frontend.
- **SupabaseConnection**: Represents the connection details to the Supabase database (URL, anon key, connection string).

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Application is accessible online and all features work with Supabase data.
- **SC-002**: Deployment process completes successfully with no manual steps in 95% of cases.
- **SC-003**: No sensitive credentials are found in the deployed frontend bundle.
- **SC-004**: 100% of users can access the app and perform key actions after deployment.
