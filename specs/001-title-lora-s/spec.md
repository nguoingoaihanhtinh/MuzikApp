## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Listener plays music and manages playback (Priority: P1)

A registered listener can search for a track and play it with basic controls (play/pause/skip/shuffle) and see current progress.

**Why this priority**: Music playback is the core value proposition; without playback the app has no utility.

**Independent Test**: With a seeded catalog and an existing listener account, the user can find a track and complete a full playback session including pause/resume and skipping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a logged-in listener and available tracks, When the listener presses Play on a track, Then playback starts within an acceptable delay and the player shows progress.
2. Given a track is playing, When the listener presses Pause, Then playback stops and can be resumed from the same position.
3. Given a queue of tracks, When the listener presses Next/Previous, Then playback jumps accordingly and updates the currently playing track.
4. Given shuffle mode is enabled, When the current track ends, Then the next track is selected randomly without repeating the immediate last track.

### User Story 2 - Listener creates and manages playlists (Priority: P1)

A listener can create, edit, reorder, and delete personal playlists and add/remove tracks.

**Why this priority**: Playlists increase retention and enable personalized listening.

**Independent Test**: With any logged-in listener, the user can create a new playlist, add at least one track, reorder it, and delete the playlist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a logged-in listener, When they create a playlist with a valid name, Then the playlist appears in their library.
2. Given an existing playlist, When the listener adds a track, Then the track appears in the playlist at the desired position.
3. Given a playlist with multiple tracks, When the listener reorders tracks, Then the new order is saved and reflected in playback.
4. Given a listener wants to delete a playlist, When they confirm deletion, Then the playlist no longer appears and is not recoverable by regular means.

### User Story 3 - Artist uploads and manages songs (Priority: P1)

An artist can upload new tracks with metadata and artwork, view their uploaded tracks, and update or remove them.

**Why this priority**: Artist-generated content is essential to populate the catalog.

**Independent Test**: With an artist account, the user can upload a new track with required metadata, see it in their dashboard, update metadata, and remove it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a logged-in artist, When they submit a valid audio file with required metadata (title, artist name, genre, cover), Then the track is accepted and becomes available for moderation or publishing based on policies.
2. Given an artist’s existing track, When they update title or artwork, Then the changes are saved and reflected in subsequent views.
3. Given an artist’s track, When they request deletion, Then the track is marked unavailable to listeners and removed from their dashboard list.
   [Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### User Story 4 - Search for songs, artists, albums (Priority: P2)

Listeners can search and filter catalog content by keywords and facets (e.g., artist, album, genre).

**Why this priority**: Enables discovery and quick access to content.

**Independent Test**: With a seeded catalog, a listener can search a keyword and receive relevant results categorized by entity type.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a listener enters a query, When results are available, Then show top results with categories for songs, artists, and albums.
2. Given filters are selected, When the listener applies them, Then the result set updates accordingly.

### User Story 5 - Admin moderates content (Priority: P2)

Admins can review reported or newly uploaded tracks and approve, reject, or remove content.

**Why this priority**: Ensures catalog quality and compliance.

**Independent Test**: With an admin account and a queue of pending items, the admin can approve or reject content and see status changes reflected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a pending upload, When an admin approves it, Then the item becomes available to listeners.
2. Given a reported track, When an admin removes it, Then it is no longer discoverable or playable by listeners.

### User Story 6 - Accessibility and theming (Priority: P3)

Users can navigate the app via keyboard, screen readers, and toggle dark mode.

**Why this priority**: Broad usability and inclusive access.

**Independent Test**: A listener can complete core flows using only keyboard and can enable dark mode with appropriate contrast.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a user prefers reduced motion, When they navigate, Then animations are minimized.
2. Given dark mode is enabled, When navigating, Then colors maintain contrast and readability.

### Edge Cases

- Invalid audio file format or oversized upload is attempted by an artist
- Network interruption occurs during track upload or playback
- Duplicate playlist name creation by the same user
- Attempt to play a removed/unavailable track
- Search with empty or very long query strings
- Rapid skip actions triggering rate limits or queue inconsistencies
- User logs out during active playback

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: The system MUST allow users to register, sign in, and sign out securely.
- FR-002: The system MUST allow listeners to play, pause, skip, and shuffle tracks.
- FR-003: The system MUST allow listeners to create, edit (rename, reorder), and delete playlists.
- FR-004: The system MUST allow listeners to add and remove tracks from their playlists.
- FR-005: The system MUST allow artists to upload audio files with required metadata and artwork, and manage their uploaded tracks.
- FR-006: The system MUST provide search across songs, artists, and albums with keyword and basic filtering.
- FR-007: The system MUST provide an admin workflow to approve, reject, or remove content.
- FR-008: The system MUST persist user preferences including theme (light/dark) and playback settings.
- FR-009: The system MUST provide basic playback queue management and display current track information.
- FR-010: The system MUST handle invalid inputs and display user-friendly error messages.

Assumptions:

- A standard email/password authentication is used with account verification.
- Uploaded content is subject to moderation before public availability.

### Non-functional Requirements

- NFR-001 (Performance): Initial page or app shell loads in under 3 seconds on a typical broadband connection.
- NFR-002 (Performance): Playback starts within 1 second for cached content and within 3 seconds for non-cached content under normal conditions.

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connectivity for streaming and uploads.
- Catalog contains sufficient seed content to enable search and playback tests.
- Content uploaded by artists may require moderation before being visible to listeners.
- Email channel is available for account verification and notifications.

### Scope Boundaries (Initial Release)

- Out of scope: offline downloads, collaborative playlists, social sharing, multi-device sync and handoff, lyrics display.
- Admin features focus on content approval/removal; advanced analytics dashboards are out of scope.
- Playback quality selection is automatic; manual bitrate selection is out of scope.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- User: represents listener, artist, or admin; attributes include id, role(s), profile, preferences.
- Track: represents an audio item; attributes include id, title, artist, album, duration, artwork, availability status.
